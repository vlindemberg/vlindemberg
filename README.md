Hey there!! I am Vinicius :wave:ðŸ˜Š

Android Developer with experience in creating and maintaining high-performance mobile applications. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work on challenging and diverse projects, which allowed me to enhance my software development skills and become a versatile professional.

I'm a big fan of Android/Mobile development and am constantly exploring the latest technologies and libraries. Lately, I have taken a particular interest in Android Jetpack libraries such as Compose, Hilt, Navigation, and more. I am proficient in Kotlin and Java, and one of my strengths is identifying ways to optimize development processes and make them more efficient and effective.

Beyond my work, I am actively involved in the development community, participating in events and meetups to share knowledge and learn from other industry professionals

I am currently working as a Android Engineer for the [PicPay](https://picpay.com/) app.
